# Rockety

This is a really flexible ready to use front-end development toolbox based on Grunt.  
You do not have to edit the gruntfile.js and mess with JavaScript.  
It is made super easy to use with a single YAML configuration file.  
All you need to do is open ```gruntfile.yaml``` and change the settings.  

## What is included

* LESS compiler  
* CSS minifier  
* CSS Autoprefixer  
* JS validation (JSHint)  
* JS minifier/uglifier  
* SVG symbols compiler

## Install

Rockety comes with a Node.js installer for easier usage.  
You have to install the installer globally with:
```
npm install rockety-cli -g
```
and use it as:
```
rockety <project-name>
```
